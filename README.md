Campus Pathfinder: University Navigation System

Project Overview

Campus Pathfinder is a simple, command-line interface (CLI) application developed in Python. It serves as a digital map and guidance system for a university campus, designed specifically to assist new students, visitors, and faculty in quickly locating essential buildings and generating basic, conceptual routes between two points.
This project is built using fundamental Python concepts, primarily utilizing dictionaries and lists to manage the campus data, making it suitable for a first-year student's portfolio.
Features
This application includes the following three major functional modules:
1.	Location Finder (FR01): Allows the user to search for a specific location (e.g., "Food court") and view its details (type and nearby neighbours).
2.	Location Filtering (FR02): Enables the user to list all available locations based on a specific category (e.g., 'Academic' or 'Residence').
3.	Basic Route Planner (FR03): Provides a conceptual, step-by-step path between a starting location and a destination using predefined central campus hubs.
Technologies Used
•	Language: Python 3.x (Console application)
•	Data Structures: Dictionaries and Lists for storing campus map data.
Installation and Setup
This is a single-file Python script (campus_navigator.py) and does not require any external library dependencies.
1.	Obtain the Source Code:
o	Save the campus_navigator.py file to your local machine.
2.	Run the Application:
o	Open your terminal or command prompt.
o	Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
o	Execute the script using the Python interpreter:
python campus_navigator.py
